# Flappy Bird Clone

![Flappy Bird Clone](screenshot.png)

This is a simple clone of the popular game Flappy Bird, developed using Unity. It's designed for both Windows and Android platforms. The game is a great example for those learning game development with Unity, and it can be a starting point for experimenting with game mechanics, graphics, and user experience.

## Gameplay

In this game, the player controls a bird and must navigate it through a series of pipes. The bird automatically moves forward, and the player can make it flap its wings to gain altitude. The objective is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding with the pipes or the ground. Each successful pipe passage awards a point. The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive one-touch controls: Just tap to make the bird flap.
- Endless procedural generation of pipes for continuous gameplay challenge.
- Score tracking: Compete with yourself to achieve a higher score.
- Sound effects: Enjoy audio feedback for bird flaps and collisions.
- Responsive design: Playable on both Windows and Android platforms.
